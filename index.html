    <p>BROOKLYN, NY (November 30, 2025) – In an<a href="https://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/pr2025/decline-in-traffic-deaths.shtml">October press release</a>from the NYC Department of Transportation, a tone of triumph took hold. According to the report, traffic fatalities have declined and 2025 was hailed as one of the “safest years in New York City history.” Accounting for the significant decrease, deaths “among drivers and occupants of motor vehicles” fell the most since last year. However, the data references pedestrian fatalities much less, and in many cases declares victory over changes across all five boroughs as a whole. As John Surico, a transportation reporter, wrote for<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-05-09/nyc-s-streets-saw-serious-injuries-rise-as-traffic-returned">Bloomberg</a>in May, despite claims of safety from city officials, “why doesn’t it feel that way?”<br>
    <br>
    Brooklyn residents may be asking this same question. In an independent review of Vision Zero traffic data, a street safety non-profit partnered with the NYC Department of Transportation, Brooklyn pedestrian injury rates increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, and have remained at the highest levels since the data began in 2012.<br><br>In 2025, over 1 in 10 Brooklyn car crashes resulted in a pedestrian with serious injury.

There have been over 20,000 Brooklyn car crashes in 2025 alone, according to Vision Zero data. Notably however, overall car collisions have decreased year-over-year since 2019. Meanwhile, pedestrian fatalities have remained more consistent, accounting for the percentage increases post-COVID. This essentially points to a trend of more dangerous car collisions across Brooklyn after 2019.<br><br>Emily Kennedy, a Transportation Planner who has worked with Vision Zero, said that during the pandemic, there was a clear trend “where there were fewer cars on the road, but they were going faster.” As a result, vehicle collisions “were more fatal during that period of time,” she said. Based on Brooklyn traffic data, it seems that borough-wide traffic recklessness, as a result of the pandemic, never left.<br><br>

According to Kennedy, there are options to address rising pedestrian fatality rates. “There are certain streets that historically have a higher proportion of crashes,” she said. “If we target these corridors, we could hone in on this problem.” Reducing the number of vehicle lanes on major streets and widening curb bumps, like extending sidewalk space at crosswalks, were two immediate suggestions. Essentially, these treatments are made to “slow vehicles down,” said Kennedy, noting that’s a major focus of future Vision Zero projects.<br><br>
